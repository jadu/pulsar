                            <p>It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
                            The regular crowd shuffles in<br />
                            There's an old man sitting next to me
                            Making love to his tonic and gin</p>

                            <p>He says, "Son can you play me a memory
                            I'm not really sure how it goes<br />
                            But it's sad and it's sweet
                            And I knew it complete
                            When I wore a younger man's clothes."</p>

                            <p>Sing us a song you're the piano man
                            Sing us a song tonight<br />
                            Well we're all in the mood for a melody
                            And you've got us feeling alright</p>

                            <p>Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
                            He gets me my drinks for free<br />
                            And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
                            But there's someplace that he'd rather be</p>

                            <p>He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
                            As a smile ran away from his face<br />
                            "Well, I'm sure that I could be a movie star
                            If I could get out of this place."</p>

                            <p>Now Paul is a real estate novelist
                            Who never had time for a wife<br />
                            And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
                            And probably will be for life</p>

                            <p>And the waitress is practicing politics
                            As the businessmen slowly get stoned<br />
                            Yes they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
                            But it's better than drinking alone</p>

                            <p>Sing us a song you're the piano man
                            Sing us a song tonight<br />
                            Well we're all in the mood for a melody
                            And you've got us feeling alright</p>

                            <p>It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
                            And the manager gives me a smile<br />
                            'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
                            To forget about life for a while</p>

                            <p>And the piano it sounds like a carnival
                            And the microphone smells like a beer<br />
                            And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
                            And say, "Man what are you doing here?"</p>

                            <p>Sing us a song you're the piano man
                            Sing us a song tonight<br />
                            Well we're all in the mood for a melody
                            And you've got us feeling alright</p>
                        </div>
