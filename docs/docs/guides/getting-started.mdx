As a Jadu designer or developer, youâ€™re probably working on one or more of the Jadu platform products (CMS, XFP and CXM). Pulsar is already installed and available for you to use in your user-interface. There are, however, some important things to know.

There are [many more people](https://github.com/jadu/pulsar/graphs/contributors) at Jadu who contribute (or have contributed) to Pulsar. The Pulsar design system is open-source under the MIT license.

## Slack channel

The [#pulsar](https://jadu.slack.com/channels/pulsar) slack channel is the main place to ask for assistance.

## Bug reports and feature requests

For issues directly related to Pulsar, you can create a bug report or a new feature request on GitHub, you will need a GitHub account to do so.

However, when you're working within a Jadu product and you find a user-interface related bug there's a good chance you may actually want to create a product bug ticket using that team's bug reporting process (usually in Jira), your Product Owner or a Pulsar team member should be able to help you decide where an issue needs reporting. Don't be afraid of creating GitHub tickets by mistake, we'll be happy to help you move them to the right place if needs be.
