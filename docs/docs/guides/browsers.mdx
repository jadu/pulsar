We automatically gather browser information from Continuum platform users to inform which browsers we design and test for.

## Supported browsers

These are the browsers we recommend testing on when developing the Continuum platform based upon a combination of analytics data and our contractual obligations to customers.

Browsers not listed may still work well, and it should be noted that this is not a list that intends to suggest that these are the only browsers the service will work on – this is simply a benchmark for testing against to ensure that the Continuum platform will likely work for as many users as possible alongside appropriate cost-effectiveness and development overhead.

## Testing with assistive technologies

User interfaces and components should be tested with a selection of assistive device to check they are appropriately interactive. When using screen reader software you should use the keyboard as the primary input method.
